# pv
A Phase Vocoder implementation in Python. Phase updates are done as proposed in Miller Puckette's paper *Phase-locked Vocoder X*.

## INSTALL
To be able run the script you will need the Scipy Stack library found here - http://www.scipy.org/install.html 

## RUN
I used Python 2.7.x and it works well. I haven't tried versions 3.x but I see no reason why the code shouldn't run smoothly on for that versions as well.
python py.py <input_file.wav> <time stretch factor> <ouput_file.wav>"
